# hello-world
Never done anything even remotely similar to this. Enjoy learning though.
A little more about me. As i stated above love to learn new things and try to do as much as i can to better myself daily. I have never done any type of coding, website design, video editing, photoshop edits, or anything much on a computer besides basically use them for gaming, which I thuroughly love to stream and play in any spare time I have. Im even noticing as I'm typing this the constant small yet noticable errors I'm making forgetting to capitalize or punctuate. But, I will learn it. It may take time, trial and error but thats all we have.
Commiting to this for the knowledge.
